# AirHub_using_cpp

INTRODUCTION:

The airline management system project is developed in C++ programming language.The project is implemented using object-oriented programming concepts. It has a passenger class that stores user details such as name, age, gender, and contact information. The passenger class is inherited by two classes, domestic and international flights. The domestic class stores information about domestic flights, such as the flight number, departure city, arrival city, and ticket price.
The international class stores information about international flights, such as the flight number, departure city, arrival city, and ticket price. The project uses file handling to store user details and ticket information. When a user books a flight, their details are stored in a text file along with the ticket information. When a user cancels their ticket, the text file is updated to reflect the cancellation.
